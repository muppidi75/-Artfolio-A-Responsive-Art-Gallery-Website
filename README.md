I developed "Artfolio: A Basic Responsive Art Gallery Website" to showcase a curated collection of art pieces. This project, built using HTML and CSS, highlights my foundational skills in web development, including responsive design and aesthetic layouts. It features a simple, clean interface optimized for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices. 

As one of my basic projects, it reflects both my early exploration of web technologies and my passion for painting and art. Through this project, I combined my interest in coding with my love for creative expression, laying the groundwork for more advanced web development in the future.
